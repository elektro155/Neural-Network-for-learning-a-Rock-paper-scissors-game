# Neural-Network-for-learning-a-Rock-paper-scissors-game
Neural network based on article: http://petlew.com/Czym-jest-sztuczna-siec-neuronowa-Wprowadzenie-dla-kazdego/
I've made it all starting from a blank page, no support except the descriprion of neural networks in mentioned article
The code has a enormous computational complexity in time (exponential) when the parameter for setting possible
values of coefficients for neurons is increased. Maybe some recursion will be a remedy for that?
